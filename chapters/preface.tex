Motivation for this thesis stems from my academic journey, spanning from my undergrad in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Thiagarajar College of Engineering, India, to my current pursuit of a Master's in Embedded Systems at Delft University of Technology, along with my professional experiences. Even during my undergraduate studies, I developed a curiosity for battery-free technologies, and my exposure to wireless networking embedded systems during my job before my Masters further fuelled my fascination for Embedded systems. So it was instantly serendipitous when I encountered the research works of Dr. Przemysław Pawełczak and Dr. Jasper De Winkel. Their profound insights into Battery Free Internet of Things (IoT) and Energy Harvesting technologies, along with their contributions to the development and enhancement of software for intermittent embedded systems, resonated with my interests. Engaging in discussions with them unveiled a world of untapped possibilities. Their pioneering research work of  the FreeBie technology—an architecture enabling Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication, propelled me to immerse myself in this exhilarating field. Despite beginning this journey with limited knowledge in this realm, the more I delved into the intricate workings of BLE communication and the nuances of the FreeBie architecture, the more impassioned I became. The opportunity to contribute to the advancement of FreeBie's capabilities and address its existing limitations was a clarion call that I couldn't resist.
